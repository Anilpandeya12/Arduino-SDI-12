Arduino-SDI-12
==============

Arduino library for SDI-12 communications to a wide variety of environmental sensors.

This library provides a general software solution, without requiring any additional hardware, for the SDI12 protocol (http://www.sdi-12.org/) for intelligent sensory instruments that typically monitor environmental data.

This project is part of a vision to create an open source hardware and software stack to deliver near real time environmental data from wireless sensor networks, such as those built by the Stroud Water Research Center for the Christina River Basin Critical Zone Observatory and other projects.
