Arduino-SDI-12
==============

Arduino library for SDI-12 communications to a wide variety of environmental sensors.

This library provides a general software solution, without requiring any additional hardware, for the SDI12 protocol (http://www.sdi-12.org/) for intelligent sensory instruments that typically monitor environmental data.
